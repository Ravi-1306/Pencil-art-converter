# SketchAI - Photo to Sketch Converter

A web-based application that transforms your photos into stunning pencil sketches instantly. Built with Flask and OpenCV, this tool uses advanced computer vision algorithms to convert ordinary images into artistic pencil drawings with just a few clicks.

## About the Project

This application applies sophisticated image processing techniques to simulate the effect of hand-drawn pencil sketches. The conversion process involves grayscale conversion, image inversion, Gaussian blur, and pixel blending to create realistic sketch effects. Users can choose between a classic black-and-white pencil sketch or a colored artistic version, all processed in real-time through an intuitive web interface.
